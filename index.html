      Research Organisation Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈæbdəl
      kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
      Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President
      of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
      Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
      decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
      Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
      Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
      programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be
      known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
      ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
      pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
      Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
      test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India
      in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
      then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
      "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
      writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
      several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
      civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
      Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
      arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
      dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
      Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]
